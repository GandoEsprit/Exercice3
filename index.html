            <h2>Guinea a country in West Africa</h2>
            <p>
                Guinea is a country in West Africa bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west. 
                It is famous for the integral nature reserve of Mount Nimba, located in the south-east of the country. 
                The reserve protects a forested mountain range that is home to local plants and animals, 
                including chimpanzees and viviparous toads. On the coast, the capital, Conakry, hosts the large mosque, 
                modern, and the national museum, which contains regional objects.

                    The integral nature reserve of Mount Nimba is located on Mount Nimba (1,752 m) which dominates the surrounding 
                    savannahs and whose slopes are covered with dense forest. This forest is home to particularly rich flora and 
                    fauna, with endemic species such as the viviparous toad (Nectophrynoides occidentalis) or chimpanzees which 
                    use stones as tools.
